samplesink, simple sample data aggregator
Copyright Â© 2008 William C. Benton

samplesink is a simple generic class for maintaining
aggregate information about a (potentially very large)
collection of samples while using constant space.  It uses
the technique described in "Updating mean and variance
estimates: an improved method" by D.H.D. West, from CACM
22(9); see http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/359146.359153

It is released under the ASL 2.0 (see LICENSE).
Documentation and unit tests will follow soon; for now,
please see the example code provided in example.cc.

samplesink is templated on three types:  SampleType,
AggregateType, and CountType.  The first is the type of your
samples, the second is the type you want to use for
aggregates (mean, standard deviation), and the third is the
type you want to use for counts.  The second defaults to
double and the third to long.

SampleType can be an arbitrary class if it provides the
basic arithmetic, comparison, and assignment operators and
you create a specialization for the meta::limits class (for
extremes).  AggregateType can be an arbitrary class if you
create a specialization for the support::math class (for a
square-root implementation).  CountType can be an arbitrary
class if it supports the increment operator.
